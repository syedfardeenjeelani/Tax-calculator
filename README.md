## Edge Cases Coverage

- **Alphanumeric Input**: Error handling for input containing both alphabets and numbers.
- **Empty Space**: Detection and handling of empty spaces in user input.
- **Space Between Numbers**: Correct handling of input with spaces between numbers.
- **Empty Input**: Error handling for cases where the user does not enter any input.
- **Negative Numbers**: Handling of negative numbers in the input fields.
- **Total Deduction Validation**: Validation to ensure the total applicable deduction does not exceed the combined annual and gross income.


## Assumptions

- **User Locale**: The application assumes that the user will be from India, and therefore, the locale string `'en'` & â‚¹ has been used.
